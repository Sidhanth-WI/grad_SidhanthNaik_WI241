In Jenkins I have created a new freestyle project.
In it I have connected the Source Code Management to my GitHub repo-https://github.com/Sidhanth-WI/Jenkins-assignment.
In the triggers section I have enabled poll SCM which checks my GitHub every minute for any new commits.
If a new commit is found it will execute the commands given in the build steps.
